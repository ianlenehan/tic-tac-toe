# Project Zero: Tic Tac Toe

The assignment was to create a web based game of tic-tac-toe, a game so simple you can win by accident. I know, because I kept winning when I was trying to test out what happens when you draw.

I have met all of the basic requirements of this game, primarily a functioning game that switches turns between X and O and visually displays which side won.

### Bonus Items

I attempted to work on some of the bonus items but ultimately found that the way I constructed my game within JavaScript meant that some of these would either be too hard or too many if statements. I was able to create a function that allowed for custom board sizes, however when I tried to match the newly created cell/rows/arrays with the front end, I hit a roadblock.

I also got started on the AI and figured that the only way I was going to make that work would be to add about 100 lines of if/else statements. I decided to forgo that option.

The game does keep a tally of how many games each side won and has some spiffy styling.

### Plugins

I used two plugins: [Sweet Alert](http://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/) for my alert boxes and [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) to create the animation each time a square is selected.
